AMQP-CMS
========

Card Management System that consumes from an AMQP queue. Internal processing uses Spring Framework. This project is purely experimental and is not meant for use in production environments. Besides, it's not even certified.

Currently, only UI stuff are being done inspired by YouTube's layout. Please don't sue me. :(

###Used Frameworks / Libraries (So far):
- Apache Tiles
- Spring MVC
